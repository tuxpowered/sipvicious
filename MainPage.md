Welcome to SIPVicious security tools.

The 4 tools that you should be looking at are:

# The tools #

## svmap ##
This is a sip scanner. When launched against ranges of ip address space, it will identify any SIP servers which it finds on the way. Also has the option to scan hosts  on ranges of ports. For usage instructions check out SvmapUsage.


## svwar ##
Traditionally a war dialer used to call up numbers on the phone network to identify ones that are interesting from ones that are not. With SIP, you can do something similar to identify active users.

This is a password cracker making use of digest authentication. It is able to crack passwords on both registrar servers and proxy servers. It can make use of ranges of numbers or a dictionary file full of possible passwords.
